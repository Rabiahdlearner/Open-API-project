        <h1>API</h1>
        <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.</p>
        <p>APIs are used to enable the integration of different systems, allowing them to work together seamlessly. They are commonly used in web development to connect front-end applications with back-end services, as well as in mobile app development to connect apps with remote servers.</p>
        <p>APIs can be public, private, or partner-specific. Public APIs are available to anyone, while private APIs are restricted to internal use within an organization. Partner APIs are shared with specific business partners for collaboration.</p>
        <p>APIs can be categorized into different types, including RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs, GraphQL APIs, and more. Each type has its own set of rules and conventions for how data is structured and exchanged.</p>
        <p>Overall, APIs play a crucial role in modern software development by enabling interoperability between different systems and applications.</p>

        <p>
            This project will make use of the Open-Meteo, a weather API that provides weather data for any location worldwide. It offers a wide range of weather parameters, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and more. The API is free to use and does not require an API key, making it easy to integrate into applications.
